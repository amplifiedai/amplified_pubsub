defmodule Amplified.PubSub do
  @moduledoc ~S'''
  A protocol-based PubSub abstraction for Phoenix LiveView.

      defmodule MyApp.Blog do
        alias Amplified.PubSub

        def create_post(attrs) do
          %Post{}
          |> Post.changeset(attrs)
          |> Repo.insert()
          |> PubSub.broadcast(:created)
        end
      end

  `Amplified.PubSub` wraps `Phoenix.PubSub` with a protocol layer so the
  same `broadcast/2`, `subscribe/1`, and `handle_info/2` calls work whether
  you pass a struct, an `{:ok, struct}` tuple from a Repo operation, a list
  of structs, or a raw channel string. This lets you weave PubSub into your
  context functions as pipeline-friendly operations that chain naturally
  with Ecto.

  ## Configuration

  Configure the PubSub server name used for subscriptions and broadcasts:

      # config/config.exs
      config :amplified_pubsub, pubsub_server: :my_app

  ## Setup

  Schema modules opt in by adding `use Amplified.PubSub`:

      defmodule MyApp.Blog.Post do
        use Ecto.Schema
        use Amplified.PubSub

        schema "posts" do
          field :title, :string
          field :body, :string
          timestamps()
        end
      end

  This generates an `Amplified.PubSub.Protocol` implementation with sensible
  defaults:

    * `channel/1` derives `"post:<id>"` from the module's last segment
      (snake_cased) and the struct's `:id` field
    * `subscribe/1` and `unsubscribe/1` subscribe via the configured PubSub server
    * `broadcast/2` wraps atom/string events as `{event, subject}` and
      publishes to the subject's channel
    * `handle_info/2,3,4` return `{:cont, socket}` (pass-through) so
      unhandled messages don't crash

  ## Broadcasting from context functions

  Since `broadcast/2` returns its first argument — and passes through
  `{:ok, _}` and `{:error, _}` tuples — it drops right into Ecto pipelines:

      defmodule MyApp.Blog do
        alias Amplified.PubSub

        def create_post(attrs) do
          %Post{}
          |> Post.changeset(attrs)
          |> Repo.insert()
          |> PubSub.broadcast(:created)
        end

        def update_post(%Post{} = post, attrs) do
          post
          |> Post.changeset(attrs)
          |> Repo.update()
          |> PubSub.broadcast(:updated)
        end

        def delete_post(%Post{} = post) do
          post
          |> Repo.delete()
          |> PubSub.broadcast(:deleted)
        end
      end

  On success, `PubSub.broadcast({:ok, post}, :created)` unwraps the tuple,
  broadcasts `{:created, post}` on the `"post:<id>"` channel, and returns
  `{:ok, post}`. On failure, `{:error, changeset}` passes through without
  broadcasting.

  ## Subscribing in LiveViews

  Subscribe a LiveView process to a subject's channel in `mount/3`. The
  subscription is idempotent — calling it twice won't produce duplicate
  messages:

      def mount(%{"id" => id}, _session, socket) do
        post = Blog.get_post!(id)
        PubSub.subscribe(post)
        {:ok, assign(socket, post: post)}
      end

  Unsubscribe when you no longer want messages:

      PubSub.unsubscribe(post)

  You can also subscribe to a raw channel string:

      PubSub.subscribe("posts:feed")

  ## Handling messages

  `PubSub.handle_info/2` returns `{:cont, socket}` or `{:halt, socket}` —
  the same convention used by `Phoenix.LiveView.attach_hook/4`. This is
  intentional: it means you can wire PubSub dispatch directly into the
  LiveView lifecycle as a hook, which is the recommended approach for
  applications with many LiveViews.

  ### Per-view dispatch

  The simplest approach is to call `PubSub.handle_info/2` in each
  LiveView's `handle_info/2`:

      def handle_info(message, socket) do
        case PubSub.handle_info(message, socket) do
          {:cont, socket} -> {:noreply, socket}
          {:halt, socket} -> {:noreply, socket}
        end
      end

  ### Global dispatch with `attach_hook`

  For applications with many LiveViews, a better approach is to subscribe
  and attach the PubSub dispatcher once as an `on_mount` hook. This way
  every LiveView in the live session gets PubSub handling automatically,
  with no per-view boilerplate.

  Define a hooks module:

      defmodule MyAppWeb.Hooks do
        import Phoenix.LiveView

        alias Amplified.PubSub

        defmodule Default do
          def on_mount(:default, _params, _session, socket) do
            {:cont, MyAppWeb.Hooks.attach_defaults(socket)}
          end
        end

        # This is the critical wiring step. attach_hook/4 registers
        # PubSub.handle_info/2 as a lifecycle hook that intercepts every
        # message the LiveView process receives. Without this, PubSub
        # messages will arrive but the protocol dispatch won't fire —
        # your schema handle_info/3 implementations won't be called.
        def attach_defaults(socket) do
          socket
          |> subscribe()
          |> attach_hook(:pubsub, :handle_info, &PubSub.handle_info/2)
        end

        # Subscribe based on whatever is assigned to the socket.
        # Unsubscribe first to prevent duplicates on reconnect.
        defp subscribe(socket) do
          if connected?(socket) do
            user = socket.assigns[:current_user]
            project = socket.assigns[:project]

            if user, do: PubSub.subscribe(user)
            if project, do: PubSub.subscribe(project)
          end

          socket
        end
      end

  Then attach the hook in the router:

      live_session :authenticated, on_mount: MyAppWeb.Hooks.Default do
        live "/posts", PostLive.Index
        live "/posts/:id", PostLive.Show
      end

  With this in place, the hook subscribes every LiveView to the current
  user and project channels and dispatches all `{action, subject}` messages
  through the protocol. Individual LiveViews can still subscribe to
  additional channels in their own `mount/3` — the hook returns
  `{:cont, socket}` for anything it doesn't handle, so the message
  continues to the view's `handle_info/2`.

  ### Event handling in schemas

  The idiomatic place to handle PubSub events is in the schema's own
  `use Amplified.PubSub` block. When a `{action, subject}` message
  arrives, the Tuple dispatcher looks up the subject's protocol
  implementation and calls its `handle_info/3`. This keeps the handling
  logic colocated with the schema it concerns.

  For example, in Phoenix 1.8+ to keep the current user up to date
  across all LiveViews, you would define a `handle_info/3` implementation
  on your `User` schema, matching the broadcast user's ID against the
  scope's current `:user`:

      defmodule MyApp.Accounts.User do
        use Ecto.Schema
        use Amplified.PubSub do
          # Match the broadcast user's ID against the scope's user ID
          # to ensure we only update when the broadcast is for *this*
          # session's authenticated user.
          def handle_info(
                %User{id: id} = user,
                :updated,
                %{assigns: %{current_scope: %{user: %{id: id}} = scope}} = socket
              ) do
            {:cont, assign(socket, current_scope: %{scope | user: user})}
          end

          def handle_info(
                %User{id: id},
                :deleted,
                %{assigns: %{current_scope: %{user: %{id: id}}}} = socket
              ) do
            {:halt, redirect(socket, to: ~p"/sign-out")}
          end
        end

        schema "users" do
          field :email, :string
          field :name, :string
          timestamps()
        end
      end

      defmodule MyApp.Blog.Post do
        use Ecto.Schema
        use Amplified.PubSub do
          def handle_info(%Post{id: id} = post, :updated, %{assigns: %{post: %{id: id}}} = socket) do
            {:cont, assign(socket, post: post)}
          end

          def handle_info(%Post{id: id}, :deleted, %{assigns: %{post: %{id: id}}} = socket) do
            {:halt, push_navigate(socket, to: ~p"/posts")}
          end
        end

        schema "posts" do
          field :title, :string
          field :body, :string
          timestamps()
        end
      end

  With these implementations in place and a global `attach_hook`
  dispatching through `PubSub.handle_info/2`, a `:updated` broadcast
  for the current `%User{}` will automatically update the scope's user on
  every connected LiveView that belongs to that user — with no
  per-view code at all. Broadcasts for other users fall through as
  `{:cont, socket}` and are ignored.

  The convention is to return `{:halt, socket}` when you've handled the
  message and you don't want other lifecycle hooks to run, and
  `{:cont, socket}` when you do. The defaults always return
  `{:cont, socket}`, so unmatched messages fall through safely.

  ## Flash messages

  The Tuple implementation recognises `{:flash, level, message}` tuples and
  calls `Phoenix.LiveView.put_flash/3` automatically:

      PubSub.broadcast("room:lobby", {:flash, :info, "Someone joined!"})

  ## Custom channels

  Override the channel derivation by passing a block to `use`:

      use Amplified.PubSub do
        def channel(%Post{slug: slug}, _ns), do: "post:#{slug}"
      end

  Or implement the protocol externally with `defimpl`:

      defimpl Amplified.PubSub.Protocol, for: MyApp.Blog.Post do
        use Amplified.PubSub, impl: true
        def channel(%{slug: slug}, _ns), do: "post:#{slug}"
      end

  When using `impl: true`, you get all the default function bodies injected
  into your `defimpl` block, so you only need to override the functions you
  want to customise.

  ## Namespaced channels

  All `channel/2` functions accept an optional namespace for scoping. This is
  useful when different LiveViews care about different aspects of the same
  resource:

      PubSub.channel(post)             # => "post:abc-123"
      PubSub.channel(post, :comments)  # => "post:abc-123:comments"

  ## Lists and streams

  Broadcasting or subscribing to a list operates on each item individually:

      PubSub.subscribe(posts)           # subscribes to each post's channel
      PubSub.broadcast(posts, :archived) # broadcasts for each post

  When broadcasting a list with more than one item, items are grouped by
  channel and sent as a single `[{item, event}, ...]` message per channel
  for efficiency. Streams are materialised to lists before operating.

  ## Protocol implementations

  Built-in protocol implementations handle the following types:

    * `BitString` — treats the string as a literal channel name; broadcasts,
      subscribes, and unsubscribes via `Phoenix.PubSub`
    * `Atom` — converts to a string channel (e.g. `:users` → `"users"`);
      broadcast is a no-op that returns the message
    * `Tuple` — unwraps `{:ok, subject}` for broadcast/subscribe; passes
      `{:error, _}` through unchanged; dispatches `{action, subject}`
      messages in `handle_info`
    * `List` — maps the operation across each element, grouping multi-item
      broadcasts by channel
    * `Stream` — materialises to a list, then delegates to the List
      implementation
    * `Phoenix.LiveView.Socket` — derives a channel from the socket's
      session ID (`"socket:<id>"`)
    * Structs via `use Amplified.PubSub` — derives channels from the
      module's last name segment and the struct's `:id` field

  ## Telemetry

  The following telemetry events are emitted:

    * `[:amplified, :pubsub, :broadcast]` — fired on every broadcast.
      Measurements are empty (`%{}`). Metadata contains `:topic` and
      `:message`.

  Attach a handler in your application to log broadcasts, collect metrics,
  or perform any other observation:

      :telemetry.attach("my-app-pubsub-log", [:amplified, :pubsub, :broadcast], fn
        _event, _measurements, %{topic: topic, message: message}, _config ->
          Logger.debug("broadcast(\#{inspect(topic)}, \#{inspect(message)})")
      end, nil)

  Injects an `Amplified.PubSub.Protocol` implementation into the calling module.

  When called without options, a full `defimpl Amplified.PubSub.Protocol`
  block is generated for the calling module's struct with default
  implementations of all protocol functions. Any function defined in an
  optional `:do` block overrides the corresponding default.

  ## Options

    * `:impl` — when `true`, injects the default function bodies *without*
      wrapping them in a `defimpl` block. Use this when writing an explicit
      `defimpl` and you want the defaults as a starting point.

    * `:do` block — functions defined here override the corresponding
      defaults. This is the primary way to customise channel derivation
      or message handling.

  ## Examples

  Basic usage generates a full protocol implementation:

      defmodule MyApp.Blog.Post do
        use Ecto.Schema
        use Amplified.PubSub

        schema "posts" do
          field :title, :string
        end
      end

  With overrides — custom channel and event handling:

      defmodule MyApp.Blog.Post do
        use Ecto.Schema
        use Amplified.PubSub do
          def channel(%Post{slug: slug}, _ns), do: "post:#{slug}"

          def handle_info(%Post{} = post, :updated, socket) do
            {:halt, assign(socket, post: post)}
          end
        end

        schema "posts" do
          field :title, :string
          field :slug, :string
        end
      end

  Inside an explicit `defimpl`:

      defimpl Amplified.PubSub.Protocol, for: MyApp.Blog.Post do
        use Amplified.PubSub, impl: true

        def channel(%{slug: slug}, _ns), do: "post:#{slug}"

  @doc ~S'''
  Broadcasts a message for the given subject.

  The behaviour depends on the subject's type, dispatched through
  `Amplified.PubSub.Protocol`:

    * **Struct** — derives the channel from the struct, wraps atom/string
      events as `{event, subject}`, broadcasts via `Phoenix.PubSub`, and
      returns the struct for pipeline chaining.

    * **`{:ok, struct}`** — unwraps the tuple, broadcasts for the struct,
      and returns `{:ok, struct}`.

    * **`{:error, reason}`** — passes through without broadcasting.

    * **String** — treats it as a literal channel name and broadcasts the
      message directly. Returns the message.

    * **List** — broadcasts for each item (grouped by channel when there
      are multiple items). Returns the list.

    * **Atom** — no-op; returns the message unchanged.

  ## Examples

  Broadcast an event for a struct:

      PubSub.broadcast(post, :created)
      # => broadcasts {:created, post} on "post:<id>", returns post

  Pipeline with Ecto Repo operations — the `{:ok, _}` / `{:error, _}`
  tuple is handled transparently:

      %Post{}
      |> Post.changeset(attrs)
      |> Repo.insert()
      |> PubSub.broadcast(:created)
      # => {:ok, post} on success, {:error, changeset} on failure

  Broadcast to a raw channel string:

      PubSub.broadcast("notifications:global", {:alert, "System update"})
      # => broadcasts {:alert, "System update"}, returns the message

  Broadcast for a list of subjects:

      PubSub.broadcast(posts, :archived)
      # => broadcasts :archived for each post, returns posts
  '''
  defdelegate broadcast(subject, message), to: Protocol

  @doc ~S'''
  Broadcasts a message with additional attributes for the given subject.

  Like `broadcast/2`, but includes an attributes map in the payload. For
  atom/string events on structs, the broadcast payload becomes
  `{event, subject, attrs}`.

  ## Examples

      PubSub.broadcast(post, :updated, %{changed_fields: [:title]})
      # => broadcasts {:updated, post, %{changed_fields: [:title]}}

  In a pipeline:

      post
      |> Post.changeset(attrs)
      |> Repo.update()
      |> PubSub.broadcast(:updated, %{changed_fields: Map.keys(attrs)})
  '''
  defdelegate broadcast(subject, message, attrs), to: Protocol

  @doc ~S'''
  Returns the PubSub channel name for the given subject.

  The channel format depends on the subject type:

    * **Struct** (via `use Amplified.PubSub`) — `"<snake_cased_module>:<id>"`,
      e.g. `"blog_post:abc-123"` for `%MyApp.Blog.BlogPost{id: "abc-123"}`.

    * **String** — returned as-is.

    * **Atom** — converted to string, e.g. `:users` → `"users"`.

    * **List** — returns a list of channels, one per element.

    * **Stream** — materialised to a list, then returns channels.

    * **Socket** — `"socket:<session_id>"`.

  An optional namespace is appended with a `:` separator.

  ## Examples

      PubSub.channel(%Post{id: "abc-123"})
      #=> "post:abc-123"

      PubSub.channel(%Post{id: "abc-123"}, :comments)
      #=> "post:abc-123:comments"

      PubSub.channel("my:channel")
      #=> "my:channel"

      PubSub.channel("my:channel", "drafts")
      #=> "my:channel:drafts"

      PubSub.channel(:users, :admin)
      #=> "users:admin"

      PubSub.channel([%Post{id: "1"}, %Post{id: "2"}])
      #=> ["post:1", "post:2"]

  def channel(subject, namespace \\ nil), do: Protocol.channel(subject, namespace)

  @doc ~S'''
  Subscribes the current process to the subject's PubSub channel.

  For structs, the subject is returned for pipeline chaining. The
  implementation first unsubscribes to prevent duplicate subscriptions,
  making the call idempotent.

  ## Examples

  Subscribe in a LiveView's `mount/3`:

      def mount(%{"id" => id}, _session, socket) do
        post = Blog.get_post!(id)
        PubSub.subscribe(post)
        {:ok, assign(socket, post: post)}
      end

  Subscribe to a raw channel:

      PubSub.subscribe("posts:feed")

  Subscribe to all items in a list:

      PubSub.subscribe(posts)
  '''
  defdelegate subscribe(channel), to: Protocol

  @doc ~S'''
  Unsubscribes the current process from the subject's PubSub channel.

  ## Examples

      PubSub.unsubscribe(post)
      PubSub.unsubscribe("posts:feed")
  '''
  defdelegate unsubscribe(channel), to: Protocol

  @doc ~S'''
  Dispatches an incoming PubSub message through the protocol.

  This is the primary entry point, typically called from a LiveView's
  `handle_info/2` callback. The Tuple protocol implementation unpacks
  `{action, subject}` messages and delegates to the subject's
  `handle_info/3`, which lets you define event handlers in your schema's
  PubSub block.

  Returns `{:cont, socket}` for unhandled messages or `{:halt, socket}`
  for handled ones.

  Flash messages are handled automatically — when `{:flash, level, msg}`
  is received, `Phoenix.LiveView.put_flash/3` is called and
  `{:halt, socket}` is returned.

  ## Examples

      # In your LiveView
      def handle_info(message, socket) do
        case PubSub.handle_info(message, socket) do
          {:cont, socket} -> {:noreply, socket}
          {:halt, socket} -> {:noreply, socket}
        end
      end
  '''
  defdelegate handle_info(message, socket), to: Protocol

  @doc ~S'''
  Dispatches a message for a specific subject and socket.

  Called internally by the Tuple implementation's `handle_info/2` after
  unpacking `{action, subject}`. Override this in your schema's
  `use Amplified.PubSub` block to handle specific events:

      use Amplified.PubSub do
        def handle_info(%Post{} = post, :updated, socket) do
          {:halt, assign(socket, post: post)}
        end
      end
  '''
  defdelegate handle_info(subject, message, socket), to: Protocol

  @doc ~S'''
  Dispatches a message for a specific subject with attributes and socket.

  Like `handle_info/3` but receives the additional attributes map that was
  passed to `broadcast/3`:

      use Amplified.PubSub do
        def handle_info(%Post{} = post, :updated, %{changed_fields: fields}, socket) do
          {:halt, assign(socket, post: post, changed: fields)}
        end
      end
  '''
  defdelegate handle_info(subject, message, changeset, socket), to: Protocol

  @doc """
  Returns the protocol implementation module for the given data, or `nil`.

  Useful for checking whether a value has a PubSub implementation before
  attempting to dispatch.

  ## Examples

      Amplified.PubSub.impl_for("a string")
      #=> Amplified.PubSub.Protocol.BitString

      Amplified.PubSub.impl_for(:an_atom)
      #=> Amplified.PubSub.Protocol.Atom

      Amplified.PubSub.impl_for(42)
      #=> nil

  """
  defdelegate impl_for(data), to: Protocol

  @doc """
  Like `impl_for/1`, but raises `Protocol.UndefinedError` if no
  implementation exists.

  ## Examples

      Amplified.PubSub.impl_for!("a string")
      #=> Amplified.PubSub.Protocol.BitString

  """
  defdelegate impl_for!(data), to: Protocol
end
